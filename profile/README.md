## Hi there. Dis is the public readme.
We work primarly at VRChat **words/avatars**, but we also have team projects in other **specs**. It may be some like *minecraft modding*, *model building*, *art making* and other creative stuff.

## The Amateur's Philosophy
So we're starting here, with 0 skills ~~or 1~~, but with ideas, I guess. We don't have to be a public community or something like this, just a silly lazy team for this time. We help you with **your** project, you help us with **our** projects.
TBO, we don't care if you've never touched GIT, Unity, Blender, etc. This repository is my second repo ever. So I need just **one basic thing** from you for now:
## HOW to Join
Our `main` monorepo with all our projects and stuff **are private now**. So you need to do one simple thing to show us you **ready to learn**, like we do.

## Shooosh. That was some complicated stuff? If you do all of that, don't you fell like `Wow, this stuff is interesting`?
Do you like how **beatufily** looks that stuff? Gc bud!
So, if you've sended this PR — you need just to wait for our responce to you.
## Important. If your PR is closed (**DENYED**). 
It **only** because we use that PR stuff like test and first lesson for our fellow teammates. It doesn't say that we denyed you.
About Privacy: **Don't worry!** Your **Pull Request** is only visible to the Team Lead only. No one from the GitHub public or other Discord users will see your application or your contact details in the PR description. This is **our private channel** for recruiting, and it's completely confidential. And yes, we reject cuz I don't think you really need your data being in public reqruit `readme` file :). And don't use *AI* for this stuff, it's already enough easy.
