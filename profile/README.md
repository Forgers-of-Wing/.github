## The Amateur's Philosophy
So we're starting here, with 0 skills ~~or 1~~, but with ideas, I guess. We don't have to be a public community or something like this, just a silly lazy team for this time. We help you with **your** project, you help us with **our** projects.
TBO, we don't care if you've never touched GIT, Unity, Blender, etc. This repository is my second repo ever. So I need just one basic thing from you for now:
## HOW to Join
Our `main` monorepo with all our projects and stuff are private now. So you need to do one simple thing to show us you ready to learn, like we do.

Do you like how beatufily looks that stuff? Gc bud!
So, if you've sended this PR -- you need just to wait for our responce to you.
#### Important. If your PR is closed (DENYED). 
It only because we use that PR stuff like test and first lesson for our fellow teammates. It doesn't say that we denyed you.
And yes, I don't think you really need your data being in public reqruit `readme` file :). And don't use AI for this stuff, it's already enough easy.
